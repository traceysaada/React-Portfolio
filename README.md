# React Portfolio

 I was not looking forward to changing my portfolio from the previous html application as I liked the one I did. I am not very confident yet with react so thought it would be very difficult. But using the react bootstrap I actually found it easier & a much neater application.

 Once I got the routing organised to the pages, finding cards on the react bootstrap & navbar was quite easy to do.


## Application

* Updated portfolio to React previous one was HTML

* Use React

* Navbar a one page navbar that links to multiple times on a single page 

* Used same information as in my previous portfolio

* click on button to navigate to the various pages 


## Instructions

* Click the link to my application & all my information is easy for an employeer to navigate through to get a quick & easy access to information for contacting me, learning more about me & having a quick access to my emails & contact details.

### Updated Portfolio

This still contains all the information my previous portfolio had but this will have the final project added the the previous one doesn't.

* About page: contains information re my career & family.

* Contact page; with Links to Facebook & LinkedIn page, as well as your email address and phone number

* A link to a my CV

* A projects: with links to the deployed site

* A Homework page with some examples of some of the homeworks I have done including links.


#### Design

The pages was put together using React bootstrap & to keep the information clear on each page I used cards with a button link to the applications some of them containg Github links.
