              This was the Decade of the Beatles, Rock a& roll, Elvis Presley,
              people just wanted to dance & go to the Flicks. A time for Hippies
              & free love, Twiggy & skinny models, hour glass figures on the way
              out, people became more into following various Fashions of the
              time including Drugs, Sex & Rock & Roll. Class structure started
              to breakdown & women gained more control of their own lives.

              Motherhood, the birth of my 3 Daughters, my greatest achievement,
              my greatest joy & my biggest weakness. Something we hope we would
              never see again happend THE FAULKLANDS WAR, fleets of our Navy war
              ships sailing out from our shores to the other side of the world,
              carrying our airforce, our soldiers. We are showing the world our
              force & finding ourselves with an enemy we didnt know we had for
              an island that was more their neighbour than ours.

              As the mother of 3 girls & having been brought up with the gender
              sterio-typing, I decided the best way to show my Daughters how to
              develop as free indepentend women was to lead by example. I
              thought the best way was to let them see that being a female in
              todays world literally means you can have it all if you want it.
              So I started by doing various courses that I could find,
              eventually going to college & doing computer studies (scary as I
              had never used a computer before), basic front end typing, excel,
              rsa, book keeping a start to getting in the world of employment
              after having time out having the children. the govenment had
              started college course refered to as return to work, so this is
              where I started.

              So now a Single Mum, 3 teenage daughters, time to put all the new
              education to good use. started my current Job, developed my own
              roll as the Company was new & needed someone to take them through
              stages of development. The owner put a lot of trust in me. I
              Helped organise & set up different departments, learned new
              computer programmes & taught others how to use them. please see my
              CV on About Me Page for all the information on my job development
              with this company. Also started to travel more & explore other
              parts of the world. got to visit Algeria, facinating country, had
              some nice holidays travelled on my own but was quite an adventure.
              I have always been lucky in that I meet lovely interesting people
              so I never really feel alone. Joined the gym, made lots of lovely
              new friends.

              Loved this decade, Watched my Girls develop into beautiful young
              ladies, carving out their own careers & dreams, marriages. I
              became a Grandma. My daughters are beautiful mothers, successfull
              career women & the most important thing of all they are happy.
              which means I am also happy. I've Watch my own career grow, I look
              after the bigger accounts at Amdec & do the buying & selling of
              all parts & some of the other products. I have continued with the
              development along side Alistair the owner of the company. The
              Company is now one of the biggest independent Forklift Companies.
              later in the decade we was made a Partner with the large
              international Company Jungheinrich & we continue to grow. We have
              moved premises & are now going to develop another side to the
              company which I have been put in charge off. So the next decade is
              the move onto the internet.

              The world has changed, World Pandemic "Cornonvirus"
            </Card.Subtitle>
            <Card.Text>
              Companies are now learning social distancing for employees. More
              sales are being made via the internet. The pandemic will change
              the way people buy, sell & do business. So my new challenge is to
              take the company I work on to the web. So I looked up coding & web
              development & here I am currently doing Full Stack Web Development
              at Manchester University. Wow It is hard, it is challenging, but
              it is also very interesting. Who knew all this went on in the back
              ground of our computers. It is the hardest thing I have ever had
              to learn but one of the most interesting. To create code & see it
              come to life is like magic & I feel like I know the magicians
              secret. love the team work that goes into coding, all the
              complexities of coding does require a team if you are to achieve
              the best. Also the feeling of achievement when you manage your
              own piece of coding & it works. There is no feeling like it. very
              interested to see where my next decade takes me as it has started
              off with such a challenging new beginning.
